    Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Represents the endpoint of a Flow. The "Nodes" of a Network. Stored
    in the SitesTable of the Network. Multiple sites may exist on the same point
    but all should have a unique ID

    Class Variables
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    id [number] : Site's ID
    latLong [LatLong] : The location of the Site 
    z [number] : Unused
    h [number] : Unused
    flowsCon [list] : List of flows connected to the Site
    assignedID [number] : Assigned Site ID
    pendingUpstream : Number of flows that have yet to be processed, -1 if none
    downwardRefID [number] : Downward reference ID for the Site, None if there isn't any

    Usage

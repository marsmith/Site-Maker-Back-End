[Overview]

A site identification number is a 8 to 10 digit long number which is given to each
groundwater site for purposes of tracking it. Historically, numbers were assigned
by hand. Based on the given watershed area the site is on and its neighbors, a 
new site id was assigned to leave enough room for future sites.

Its like trying to give street addresses, leaving enough room for more houses
on the street, even though this street branches off into multiple different directions



[Algorithm]
0. Import all data pertinent to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE allowed using GDAL (how big will our search area possibly get)
1. Draw a circle geometry around the x,y provided using GDAL 
2. Isolate a network based on the lines in the circle and the line clicked with x,y
    (even though there may be many lines in the circle, only those connected to the target
    are selected)
    * If the circle previous was too small, we will expand the circle until either reaching the recommended size
    * or until we exceed max size.

3. If there are no existing sites on the network selected, goto step 9. If there is one, go to step 4,
    if there are more than one, go to step 7

SINGLE_REAL_SITE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Perform the iSNA algorithm to identify "fake-site" SiteID objects for all nodes from the click line to
    the sink (or outlet,outflow,etc). Return an ordered list of these "fake-sites" we encountered

5. Perform a pSNA algorithm on each iSNA "fake-site" encountered. After this the tree is populated
6. Interpolate the SiteID based on start line in network (and return the new SiteID we want, hopefully)

MULTIPLE_REAL_SITES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Do a "testFlight" runthrough of the network, starting from the base (or outlet,outflow,etc.). Keep track
    of when we encounter each object in the network (Site,Flow). If we encounter a real site, mark its index in the list
    If we encounter the start line (clicked by x,y), mark that index as well
8. Determine the scenario of real sites around the clicked line.
    SCENARIO A: <>---***---<> Real Sites surrounding the start line (any distance away)
        Perform a special version of pSNA where we only populate the network's "fake-sites" from the downstream site relative
        to the start line and the upstream site realtive to the start line.
        After this, go to step 6.
    SCENARIO B: <>---***--- Real Sites only before the start line
        Run pSNA as usual but start one node up and do the calculation for the initial flowline manually
        After this, got to step 6
    SCENARIO C: -----***---<> Real Sites only after the start line
        Go to step 5

NO_REAL_SITES (in range) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Run the isolateNetwork algorithm again (steps 1-3), with an expanded search radius (increasing the clump factor)
    If there are still no sites in range to base off of, then go to 10
10. Calculate a new first four digit number series, either in a gap that exists in the NY_Sitefile or create one after the highest
    four digit number series. Then, concatenate this with 5000 to get the new number (mathematically, multiply the first four digits by 10,000 then add 5,000)

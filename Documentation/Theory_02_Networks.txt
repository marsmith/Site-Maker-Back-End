A Network is a relationship between nodes; a graph (in mathematical and computer science terms). A node can be anything, 
cars, people, you name it!

In our case, a Network is a collection of Site objects and Flow objects.

A Site is a location in the network where a Flow ends, or meets another flow or two, or even three sometimes! :o
Each Site has a Simple ID#, an [AssignedID] #, a LatLong object, and other fields specific to the internals of the program.
Each site also knows what else it connects to. These are stored as tuples in flowsCon, a list of tuples
    (Site im connected to, relationship to me, Flow that gets me there)
        Site <0>  (obj),    UPSTREAM_CON    , Flow <2> (obj)    <------- If this is in flowsCon for Site<1>, we can say Site<0> is 
                                                                         upstream of Site <1> and is reachable by Flow #2
* Note: A Simple ID is NOT the same as an AssignedID.

[Simple ID vs AssignedID]
A SimpleID is just an integer which is assigned to each node on the network, just to help establish relationships.
An AssignedID is the final SiteID object which is associated with every Site object on the Network.

["Fake-Site" vs. Real-Site]
A "Fake-Site" is a Site object which has no AssignedID in the begining. A Real-Site is a Site object
which DOES have an AssignedID in the begining. It will corespond to its real-world equivalent.
The two are also differentiable via a boolean called "isl", like this:
    site = (a site object)
    if site.isl:
        print("This site is a real one")


A Flow represents a stretch of river,stream, or water path between two places. 
Each Flow has a length, a ReachCode, and a simple ID #.
Each Flow also stores an upstreamSite, and a downstreamSite. 

* Note: Multiple Flow's can have the same upstream or downstreamSite

If multiple Flows share the same upstreamSite and then reconnect to each other,
this is a Loop case

[Loops]
Loops occur in nature typically in a "daisy-chained" river, where due to natural forces, a river
may develop islands in the middle. When these show up in the Line Data, these can form loops.

This program handles loops by treating the connecting Flow at the top as unadressable however it still remains accessible.
To know if a Flow is unadressable, simply use:
    <myFlowObject>.unadressable

Flows which are Unadressable will not be able to be used to generate a new SiteID, so be careful!


------<-------(1)----------<-----(2)----<------- ...
                |                 |                     In this case, the flow from 3 to 2 will probably end up unadressable,
                |-------(3)----<--|                     But 1 to 3 is not effected. This is a downside if you need to be very specific but 
                                                        Works well if the loop is small and you dont need to worry.

[ Shapefile Operations ]

A shapefile is a file used to contain geometry data. This geometry data can then
be used to represent things on the planet, in our case we use "Projected Geometry Data"
which is "proected" into a Projected Coordinate System

A Projected Coordinate System is a way to convert a globe-like Geographic Coordinate System
way of pinpointing location (latitude,longitude) in degrees into a flat map using standard
distance units like meters, or feet.

This is useful when performing calculations such as seeing how many Sites exist within 5 km of a user
clicking somewhere

* Note: All incomming shapefiles must be pre-projected into EPSG:26918, or NAD83 UTM Zone 18n
* before the program runs. This is to save on runtime while the program is running

[ The Expanding Buffer ]

The first operation of the program is to import the shapefile data and then "plot"
a user's click (x,y) in the Projected Coordinate System onto the existing line data.
A circle is drawn around the x,y; initially it is a minimum size of 1 km, but if no
pre-existing sites exist in that area to use as a reference, the circle will be expanded
by 1 km until it reaches a maximum allowed size.

This maximum allowed size is determined by a few things (order lower to higher value):
    A recommended value (based on the density of sites in the state and a clump factor (a scalar))
    A fixed max cap (Used as a maximum to prevent python from not responding)

All the lines that fall within the max-cap are candidates to be added. Only the site

[ Network Isolation ]

A Network is isolated from the lines inside the circle (buffer) and any real sites which may exist.
"Fake-Sites" are also included (these are wherever two lines or more meet or at the ends of lines)

This isolated network is used in determining what the ID of a new site should be 
(See Interpolation and See Network)

From Wikipedia:
"In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a type of estimation,
     a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points"

In the Site-Maker Addonis project, we use this at the final and crucial stage of determining
what the new SiteID should be. It requires that we define a set range of values which
it can be, and this is done before in the (population of the "fake-sites") step.

[ Interpolating to find the SiteID ]


Assuming we have a populated network, we find the line in the network (Flow) which
coresponds to the line the user clicked on with the x,y coordinate.

clickedFlow = (the Flow in the network which I clicked on)

Each Flow object in a network has an upstreamSite and a downstreamSite
defined. These are what are given assignedID's in the various stages of the overview.

If we label them by assignedID's, they may look like this

<01203949> UPSTREAM SITE or US#
|
|
|
|              If we clicked where the x is,
x              then we know what range x's ID can be!
|
|
<01203956> DOWNSTREAM SITE or DS#

If x is 1/3 upstream of the DOWNSTREAM_SITE, we can say that x is 1/3 the difference in ID from the upstream site and the
downstream one. Lets call this fraction F
Lets call the length of the flowline L

delta# = 01203956 - 01203949 = 7

If we say that for every m, a new ID may be assigned, the network's unit length (UL) is 1. 
This is the easiest case but does not always happen

newID = (delta# * F)

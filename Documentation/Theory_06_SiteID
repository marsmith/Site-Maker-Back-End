A SiteID is a class; it stores the groundwater site_no broken up into sections
A groundwater site_no is typically a 8-10 digit number.

[    VALUE   ]     [Extension]

The VALUE portion is the 8 digit part. If the number is 8 digits long only, it has no Extension
The EXTENSION portion is only added on if there exists ID's with the same VALUE portion.
    There is no explicit check for this, it is based on mathematics of adding or subtracting distances from a SiteID class

[ Operations ]

Addition
    (SiteID + SiteID)
        Not really implemented, but will return what happens if you add each Site's full ID'same
        together. There are no extension checks, no safeguards. 
    (SiteID + number)
        This will return a new SiteID based on the number you are adding to it.
        If we tick over to a SiteID greater in VALUE to the previous while were adding, we increase the VALUE
        portion but leave the extension blank

        Example:

        01204561 + 4 = 01204565

        0120456070 + 4 = 01204564

        
        To make this number dependent on the Unit Length of a network, simply do
        SiteID + (number * UL) to take into account UnitLength

If there is a real lower site but no real upper site, then we run pSNA but plug in the 
real site's ID as the maxDownstreamID

If we have an upper site but no lower site, then we run the isolated network (based on GDAL and user click x,y)
using iSNA

If we have two or more sites on the GDAL isolated network, we must isolate a new network that encompases the line clicked
as well as all sites and flows that would be encountered in order going from the closest real site to the sink
and the closest real site upstream (in order of execution) from the line selected
    -> Steps: Run code to get order of encounter of all sites and flows on the network. Make special tags to 
    store when a real site is encountered and when we encountered our target flow

    [(*) , () , () , ---, (), (*), (*) ] = example list of execution encounter (*) = REAL, --- = Target flow
    Now, only generate a network using this information

    Once the network is isolated, we must compute a unit length for the network
        Based on the length  and the difference in number between the two sites closest
        (in order of execution) to the target line
                                                        in the above example, index 0 and index 5, call these lower site and upper site
        
        UL = (Difference in Number between upper site and lower site )/ (Length between upper site and lower site)
        If UL is negative:
            The lower site is invalid in numbering, so just use network based on UL of 1 and using the singular real
            approach
        
        Else
            Compute fake sites based on unit length

Consolidate like end-points from geojson

calculateUpstreamDistances() -- Will calculate flow distance for entire upstream flows 
from the current flow

removeUseless() -- Remove sites which have one flow in
and one flow out. Will modify flow table to reflect this


Testing: See the numbers generated by network
after running the following calculateUpstreamDistances

   dictt = importJSON("SmallNet001.json")
   net = isolateNet(dictt)    
   sinks = calculateSink(net)
   removeUseless(net)
   assert(len(sinks) == 1)
   calculateUpstreamDistances(net,sinks[0])
   idByProportion(net,9999,1001)

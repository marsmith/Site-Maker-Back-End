Snapping Sites Process

1. Removed Unnecesary sites
  -> Sites with a SiteID longer than 10 digits
  -> Sites with agency use O
  
2. Created buffer geometry around entire NHD Flowline (to 10 meters away)
3. Selected and auto snapped NY_Sites within that buffer (i.e. Sites that are within 10 m of NHDFlowline
4. Manually snapped the remaining sites by hand according to properties like their name, proximity to a flowline
    or near where they are located featurewise (mouth, lake, etc.)
    
5. Review remaining outlier sites
6. Remove sites not even close to NY (i.e. in Alaska)

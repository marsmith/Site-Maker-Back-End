1. Click on a flowline
2. Using the reach-code, lookup data to pull
3. Pull Flowline and all connected to it
4. Form a network from this 

5. Calculate Upstream dist
6. Calculate total length


7. Do a buffer on Flowline select and NY_Sitefile
8. Add sites which fall within buffer (a generous one)
9. Plot sites onto the line
10. Isolate subnet from downstream of the new-site to upstream along each branch until reaching another site
    or the ends
11. Focus on this Subnet; Calculate Unit Length


SCENARIO A

--(0)-----(*)-------|-------(0)     New Point is surrounded by 
                    |               existing sites or ends of branches
                    |-----------

Solve for ID using proportional alg and unit length


SCENARIO B

-------(*)-------|-------(0)     New Point is semi-surrounded by 
                 |               existing sites or ends of branches ( not on one side)
                 |-----------

12. Poll for surrounding networks (Look for networks in a radius expanding outward until we can form convex hulls
which surround the new-site network)
13. For Each surrounding network
    a. Calculate total length
    b. Calculate this and upstreama
    b. Calculate unit length (by snapping on existing sites and doing math)
    c. If network has no sites on it, add for it to have address space allocated?
        PROBLEM!

SCENARIO C

----------(*)-------|---------------    New Point is alone on the network
                    |               
                    |-----------
